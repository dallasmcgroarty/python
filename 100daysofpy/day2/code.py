### Tip calculator project

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bill = float(input("How much is the bill? "))
people = int(input("How many people splitting the bill? "))
tip = int(input("How much is the tip in percent? "))

pay_per_person = round((bill / people) * (tip / 100 + 1), 2)
