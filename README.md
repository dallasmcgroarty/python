# python

learning me some python!

All my python studying and learning is recorded here for me to see my own progression, but also to show employers what I've learned (in case they care to look!).

Took a Python Bootcamp course on Udemy, as well as a Data Structures and Algorithms course with Python.

Currently working with a course on Django development, but that's in a seperate repository

Currently taking a Machine Learning and Data Science course with Python.
