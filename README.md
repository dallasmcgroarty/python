# python

learning me some python

Took a python course on Udemy and continuing to practice python for most coding problems/interview practice

Currently taking a course on Django development

Will be taking a machine learning course with Python as Data Science/Ai/Machine Learning really interests me

Also, I am thinking of taking a course on Flask as well. Django is great so far, but I've heard some cool things about Flask that really interest me. Just learning more is what I'm really after, so the more Python libraries, frameworks, etc... the better!
