Support Vector Machines **

- support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning
    models with associated learning algorithms that analyze
    data and recognize patterns, used for classification and 
    regression analysis


- an SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space
    mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided
    by a clear gap that is as wide as posible
    - new examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted
        to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall
