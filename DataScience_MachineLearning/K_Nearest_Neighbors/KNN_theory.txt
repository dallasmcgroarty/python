** K Nearest Neighbors Theory **

K Nearest Neighbors is a classification algorithm

Training algorithm:
    1. Store all data

Prediction algorithm:
    1. Calculate the distance from x to all points in your data
    2. Sort the points in your data by increasing distance from x
    3. Predict the majority label of the "k" closest points

Choosing a K will affect what class a new point is assigned to

Pros:
    - very simple
    - training is trivial
    - works with any number of classes
    - easy to add more data
    - few parameters
        - K
        - Distance Metric

Cons:
    - high prediction cost (worse for large data sets)
    - not good with high dimensional data
    - categorical features dont work well
