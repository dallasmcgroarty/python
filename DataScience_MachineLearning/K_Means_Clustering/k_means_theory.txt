K Means Clustering **

K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that will
    attempt to group similar clusters together in your data

Typical clustering problems:
    - cluster similar documents
    - cluster customers based on features
    - market segmentation
    - identify similar physical groups

Overall goal is to divide data into distinct groups such that
    observations within each group are similar

How it works:
    - choose number of clusters 'K'
    - randomly assign each point to a cluster
    - until clusters stop changing, repeat the following:
        - for each cluster, compute the cluster centroid by taking
            the mean vector of points in the cluster
        - assign each data point to the cluster for which the centroid
            is the closest

No easy answer for choosing a best K value

One way is to use the elbow method:

    -First compute the sum of squared error (SSE) for some values of K

    -The SSE defined as the sum of the squared distance between each
        member of the cluster and its centroid

    -If you plot k against the SSE, you will see that the error decreases
        as k gets larger; this is because when the number of clusters
        increases, they should be smaller, so distortion is also smaller

    -The idea of the elbow method is to choose the k at which the 
        SSE decreases abruptly
