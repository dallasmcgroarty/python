Logistic Regression **

Logistic Regression as a method for Classification

Logistic Regression allows us to solve Classification problems,
    where we are trying to predict discrete categories

Normal linear regression models on binary groups wont be a good fit

Sigmoid Function for logistics
    - any value inputted will always output a value between 0 and 1

So, we can take a linear regression solution and place it into 
    the Sigmoid Function.
    Creating a logistic model

Use confusion matrix to evaluate our model
