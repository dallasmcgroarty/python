PCA ** 

unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations
    among a set of variables in order to identify the underlying
    structure of those variables

also known as a general factor analysis

factor analysis determines several orthogonal lines of best fit
    to the data set

orthogonal means "at right angles"
 - perpendicular to each other in n dimensional space

most challenging part is interpreting the components
