# *** Supervised Learning ***

# supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, 
# such as an input where the desired output is known
# for example a segment of text could havea category label such as:
    # spam vs legitimate emails
    # positive vs negative moview review


# how it works:
    # networks receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs,
    # and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with corect outputs
    # to find errors
    # it then modifies the model accordingly

# supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data
# predicts likely future events
