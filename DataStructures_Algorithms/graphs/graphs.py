# graphs are a more general structure of a tree
# can be used to represent many real world things, roads, flights, internet
# graph algorithms to solve difficult problems

# vertex or node in a graph an have a key and/or payload
# edge - connection between two vertices to show there is a relationship
# edges can be one way or two way
# edges may be weighted to show distance, etc..

# a graph is represented as G=(V,E), where G is graph, V is vertices and E is edges
# edge is a tuple (v,w) where w,v are in V

# Path - sequence of vertices connected by edges
# Cycle - a path that starts and ends at the same vertex
# DAG - directed acyclic graph

# Adjacency List and Matrix
